# Spawn Control
This mod allows you to control various aspects of events that occur at the end of the moon that cause cards to be spawned.

## Spawn Location
You can limit where objects that are spawned at the end of the moon will appear on the board.
Choose the location in the Mod's configuration page.
You can choose:
* Center of the Board
* Upper Left Corner
* Upper Right Corner
* Lower Left Corner
* Lower Right Corner
* Anywhere on the Board (game default).

This does not affect enemies that are spawned from exploring locations or bosses summoned by combined chests with keys or bringing strange objects to temples/cathedrals.
If you want those to spawn in a certain location, put them in that location before you explore/combine them.

## Event Frequency Control
You can also change the frequency with which end of month events occur in the game:
* Strange Portals
* Rare Portals
* Pirate Ships (on the island)
* Travelling Cart

Each can individually be set to Never, Infrequently, Normal Frequency, Frequently, or Every Moon.
Obviously the game is more difficult if you increase the frequency of Strange Portals, Rare Portals, or Pirate Ship.
There are a few quirks here. The travelling cart can only arrive on odd numbered moons. For reasons.

## Animal Roaming Control
By enabling Roam Free Animals, your board no longer has to deal with animal bouncing all over the place. Ideal for those who like to arrange their boards in specific ways.
Combined with the first feature, your board setup should be safe from being messed up by Animals and/or Enemies.

## Draggable Enemies
When enabled, you can move red mob cards around on the board. This does not allow you to start fights by dropping red cards on villagers. But, you can move annoying
enemies to wherever you would like to fight them (or avoid fighting them).

## Future ideas
* I've thought about changing the chances of enemies spawning from purple location cards. But haven't done that. Would that interest anyone?
* I feel as though I've over customized the game with the event frequency changes. Should I combine them all into one control setting instead of there being 4 settings?
Part of the reason to change this is to make it easier to save the frequency status in the save game like the other challenge mods below.
