# Spawned Enemies Control
This mod allows you to control various aspects of events that occur at the *end of the moon* that can cause cards to be spawned.

## Spawn Location
You can limit where objects that are spawned at the end of some moons will appear on the board.
Choose the location in the Mod's configuration page.
You can choose one of the folling places:
* Center of the Board
* Upper Left Corner
* Upper Right Corner
* Lower Left Corner
* Lower Right Corner
* Anywhere on the Board (game default).

This does not affect enemies that are spawned from exploring locations or bosses summoned by combining chests with keys
or bringing strange objects to temples/cathedrals. If you want those to spawn in a certain location,
put them in that location before you explore/combine them.

## Frequency of Dangerous Summons
You can also change the frequency with which end of month dangerous events (*Strange Portals* and *Pirate Ships*) occur in the game.
This can be set to: *Never*, *Infrequently*, *Normal Frequency*, *Frequently*, or *Every Moon*.
Obviously the game is more difficult if you increase the frequency of Dangerous Summons.

## Frequency of Traveling Cart
Same as above, except it controls the frequency of the Traveling Cart.
A quirk of the traveling cart is that is cannot be more frequent than *Every other Moon*.

## Allow Rare Portals to Occur
Normally, every fourth *Strange Portal*, the portal "seems stronger than usual", a.k.a. a *Rare Portal*.
The enemies that emerge from a Rare Portal are 50% stronger than the enemies from a normal *Strange Portal*.
Set this toggle to OFF to make all portals merely strange ones.

## Allow Animals to Roam
Normally, animals hop about on the screen messing up all the nice neat card arrangements you make.
By default, this setting is **ON**. Turning it **OFF** means animals will stay where you put them without an
*animal cage*, *animal pen*, or *aquarium*. You will still need to use these buildings if you want to see the
animals' progress toward dropping whatever they periodically might drop or if you want to stack animals.

## Allow Notifications
When play starts, a notification is displayed telling the player where spawns will occur and with what frequency.
If you don't care to see this notification, turn it **OFF** here.

# Changelog
1.0.0 Release

[Github](https://github.com/jmucchiello/stacklands-spawncontrol)

The origin of this mod was to make it possible to setup automation and not have a random portal mess it up. The *Spawn Location*
and *Allow Animals to Roam* settings were the main way to accomplish this. The other settings were logical additions to the mod, I hope.

## Future ideas
* Eventually, I will make it possible to save the frequency information to the save file so you can have a play through where you can't change the frequency.
* I've thought about changing the chances of enemies spawning from purple location cards. But haven't done that. Would that interest anyone?
