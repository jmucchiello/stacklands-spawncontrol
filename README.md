# Spawn Control
This mod allows you to control various aspects of events that occur at the end of the moon involving Enemies.

## Spawn Location
You can limit where objects that appear at the end of the moon will appear on the board.
Choose the location in the Mod's configuration page.
You can choose:
* Center of the Board
* Upper Left Corner
* Upper Right Corner
* Lower Left Corner
* Lower Right Corner
* Anywhere on the Board (game default).

This does not affect enemies that are spawned from exploring locations or bosses summoned by combined chests with keys.
If you want those to spawn in a certain location, put them in that location before you explore them.

## Event Frequency Control

You can also change the frequency with which end of month events occur in the game:
* Strange Portals
* Rare Portals
* Pirate Ships (on the island)
* Travelling Cart

Each can individually be set to Never, Infrequently, Normal Frequency, Frequently, or Every Moon.
Obviously the game is more difficult if you increase the frequency of Strange Portals, Rare Portals, or Pirate Ship.
There are a few quirks here. The travelling cart can only arrive on odd numbered moons. For reasons.

## Animal Roaming Control

Finally, you can make it so that Animals don't bounce around.
This is for players who hate when Animals disrupt their board setup.
Combined with the first feature, your board setup should be safe from being messed up by Animals and/or Enemies.
